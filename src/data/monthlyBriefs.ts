  'id-bali': {
    1: "January drops you right into monsoon season — expect daily downpours, 309mm of rain, and 92% humidity that'll have your sunglasses fogging up the moment you step outside. The upside? Crowds thin out to low-season levels, the rice terraces around Ubud are at their most electric green, and you can snag villa deals that would make July visitors weep. Sea temps sit at a balmy 28°C, though jellyfish are present and visibility takes a hit, so divers may want to stick to calmer sites. Dengue-carrying mosquitoes are active, so pack repellent and long sleeves for dusk. This is prime time for temple-hopping, Balinese cooking classes, and working your way through plates of Nasi Goreng without the summer crowds elbowing in.",
    2: "February is still firmly monsoon territory with 282mm of rain, but the showers tend to be shorter and more theatrical than January's — think dramatic afternoon cloudbursts followed by golden light. Crowds remain refreshingly low (busyness 3/5), and the warmth never dips below 20°C, so it's hardly suffering. The sea is 28°C and calm enough for snorkeling off Amed, though jellyfish linger and dive visibility stays modest. Dengue season continues, so keep that repellent handy. If you don't mind planning around the rain, February rewards you with lush jungle hikes, empty beach clubs in Seminyak, and satay vendors who actually have time to chat.",
    3: "March is the monsoon's grand finale — and it goes out swinging with 315mm of rain, the wettest month on the calendar. Humidity hovers around 91%, but sunshine hours actually start climbing to nearly 9 per day, hinting at the dry season ahead. Nyepi (Balinese New Year) often falls in March, when the entire island goes silent for 24 hours — no lights, no travel, no noise — and it's genuinely one of the most extraordinary cultural experiences in Southeast Asia. The sea warms to 28°C, crowds stay low, and the jungle canopy is impossibly dense and green. Just respect the jellyfish warnings and keep those mosquito defenses up through the month.",
    4: "April marks the glorious pivot — monsoon retreats, rainfall nearly halves to 198mm, and sunshine pushes past 9 hours a day. This is shoulder season done right: crowds tick up slightly (4/5) but the island hasn't hit full tourist throttle yet. The sea hits a gorgeous 29°C with improving visibility, making it a sweet spot for divers and freedivers heading to Nusa Penida or Tulamben. Jellyfish season wraps up and dengue risk finally drops, so you can bare those ankles without anxiety. The rice paddies are lush and actively being planted — grab a Rendang at a warung in Sidemen and watch the farmers work the terraces below.",
    5: "May is Bali's quiet overachiever — 10+ hours of sunshine, only 151mm of rain, and sea temps peaking at a bathtub-warm 29.5°C, the highest all year. Crowds are moderate and the vibe shifts: Uluwatu's swells start building for surf season, and underwater visibility sharpens beautifully for diving around Menjangan Island. The rice paddies are growing tall and vivid green, humidity is manageable, and you're paying shoulder-season prices for what feels like peak-season weather. Indonesian cuisine shines year-round, but there's something about eating fresh Klepon on a quiet Canggu porch with 10 hours of daylight that just hits different. Arguably Bali's best-kept-secret month.",
    6: "June ushers in the dry season proper — 136mm of rain, over 10 hours of daily sunshine, and that perfect 29°C sea temperature that makes every beach day feel earned. Temps cool slightly to a pleasant 21°C average, meaning nights on the Ubud ridgeline are actually comfortable without AC. Surf season is in full swing at Uluwatu and Padang Padang, with consistent swells and offshore winds. Crowds build to 4/5 as European summer holidays begin, so book your Seminyak beach club daybed in advance. The rice paddies are tall and luminous, dive conditions are excellent around Nusa Lembongan, and this is arguably when Bali's food scene peaks — night markets buzz and every warung is firing on all cylinders.",
    7: "Peak season hits hard — July is Bali at its busiest (5/5) with sun-chasing tourists from every hemisphere claiming their patch of sand. But they're not wrong to come: only 123mm of rain (the driest month), over 10 hours of sunshine, and those cool 20°C nights that make sleeping blissful. Uluwatu delivers world-class surf, Amed and Tulamben offer crystal visibility for divers, and the Kecak fire dance at sunset is pure magic. The catch? Prices spike, Seminyak traffic becomes a contact sport, and you'll need reservations everywhere. Pro tip: escape to Sidemen or the northern coast for that quieter Bali the Instagram accounts promise. Rice paddies are browning now (harvest season), so temper your terrace photo expectations.",
    8: "August matches July's peak crowds (5/5) and keeps the dry-season party going — 136mm of rain, 10+ hours of sun, and comfortable 20°C evenings. The rice paddies are in their brown, post-harvest phase through October, so if emerald terraces are your dream shot, recalibrate toward the jungle waterfalls instead. Surf conditions at Uluwatu remain excellent, diving visibility is outstanding, and the sea at 28.5°C stays inviting. Galungan and Kuningan festivals often fall in August, draping every temple and home in bamboo penjor poles — it's breathtaking. Budget for peak pricing and book early, but know that Bali in August, even crowded, still delivers moments that make you forget anyone else is on the island.",
    9: "September is the dry season's graceful exit — sunshine actually peaks at 10.6 hours per day, crowds ease back to 4/5, and you get that golden-hour light that photographers live for. Rain creeps up to 154mm but rarely disrupts plans. Sea temperature rebounds to 28.8°C and diving conditions remain stellar, especially for manta ray encounters off Nusa Penida. The rice paddies are still in their drier phase, but new plantings begin and green slowly returns to the terraces. Surf swells start to mellow, making it friendlier for intermediate surfers. This is smart-traveler Bali: nearly peak-season weather at shoulder-season prices, with shorter queues for everything from Tirta Empul to the best Rendang in Denpasar.",
    10: "October straddles the line — the wet season officially returns with 220mm of rain, but you still get a generous 10.3 hours of sunshine and the sea stays at 29°C. Crowds drop to low-season levels (3/5), prices soften, and the rice terraces begin their transformation back to vivid green as new plantings take hold. The first monsoon showers are usually manageable afternoon affairs, nothing like the January deluges. Jellyfish start appearing and mosquito season kicks in, so pack accordingly. This is an underrated month for food-focused travel — hit the warungs in Gianyar market, take a cooking class in Ubud, and enjoy having Bali's temples largely to yourself.",
    11: "November means business — 293mm of rain, jellyfish in the water, dengue mosquitoes at dusk, and that thick 92% humidity that makes everything feel slightly tropical-apocalyptic. But here's the thing: the island is stunningly lush, the rice paddies glow neon green, and crowds are at their lowest. Sea temps hold at a warm 29°C, and between downpours you'll get nearly 9.5 hours of sunshine — the rain comes in dramatic bursts, not all-day grey. Diving visibility drops but snorkeling off the calmer northern coast stays decent. If you're the type who packs a rain jacket and rolls with it, November rewards you with rock-bottom prices, empty Uluwatu clifftops, and the full force of Bali's jungle beauty.",
    12: "December brings the heaviest rainfall of the year at 322mm and the return of holiday crowds (busyness 4/5) — it's a peculiar combination of monsoon and peak pricing that only the Christmas-NYE rush can produce. The upside is 29°C days, the rice terraces at maximum green intensity, and a festive energy as Seminyak and Canggu dress up for the holidays. Jellyfish and dengue mosquitoes are in full effect, so ocean time requires caution and evenings demand repellent. Surfing shifts to the eastern breaks, and divers should manage visibility expectations. The island's Hindu-Balinese culture carries on beautifully beneath the tourist buzz — catch an offering ceremony at a sea temple between rain showers and you'll remember why everyone keeps coming back.",

  'jp-kyoto-kansai': {
    1: "Kyoto in January is quiet, cold, and absolutely magical — think frost-dusted zen gardens, steaming bowls of ramen, and temples blanketed in occasional snow, all with highs around 8°C and almost no crowds. Hatsumode (New Year shrine visits) fill Fushimi Inari with lantern light in early January, and the crisp air makes hiking the bamboo groves of Arashiyama a refreshing experience. Warm up with matcha and mochi in a traditional tea house — you've earned it after braving temperatures that can dip below freezing. This is insider-season Kyoto: the beauty without the battle for elbow room.",
    2: "February keeps Kyoto chilly (hovering around 4-5°C average) and blissfully uncrowded, making it perfect for contemplative temple-hopping without the selfie-stick obstacle course. Early plum blossoms begin appearing at Kitano Tenmangu shrine, hinting at the floral explosion to come. The food scene is at its winter peak — think rich, warming kaiseki courses and the best seasonal sushi. Pack layers and a good scarf, but know that the low rainfall and increasing sunshine make this a surprisingly pleasant month to explore. You'll feel like you have the ancient capital almost to yourself.",
    3: "Spring stirs in Kyoto as temperatures climb to a pleasant 14-15°C and the first cherry blossoms start budding in late March — the anticipation is electric. Crowds begin building (busyness 4/5) as word spreads that sakura season is imminent, so book accommodation well in advance. The Higashiyama Hanatoro illumination lights up temple paths and bamboo groves with thousands of lanterns, and the hiking trails through the eastern mountains come alive with early wildflowers. Rain picks up noticeably this month, so an umbrella is non-negotiable. Come for the blossoms, stay for the tempura and the sense that something spectacular is about to happen.",
    4: "April is peak Kyoto — cherry blossoms explode across every temple garden, canal, and mountainside, and the entire city transforms into a pink-and-white dreamscape around 18°C. But let's be honest: everyone else had the same idea, and busyness hits maximum (5/5), so expect shoulder-to-shoulder crowds along the Philosopher's Path and in Maruyama Park. Hanami picnics under the sakura are a must, and seasonal cherry blossom mochi appears in every sweet shop. Rain is significant at 163mm, so waterproof layers are essential between the photo ops. Worth every elbow? Absolutely — just book six months ahead and embrace the beautiful chaos.",
    5: "May brings Kyoto's sweet spot: warm days around 23°C, lush green bamboo groves, and the post-cherry-blossom crowd thinning that lets you actually enjoy the temples. The Aoi Matsuri festival (May 15) features an ancient imperial procession through the city that's one of Kyoto's three great festivals — genuinely spectacular. Fresh green tea season means the matcha is at its most vibrant, and the hiking in the surrounding mountains is superb with new foliage everywhere. Rainfall is notable at 183mm so afternoons can be showery, but mornings tend to be glorious. This is arguably the most underrated month to visit Kyoto.",
    6: "June marks the arrival of tsuyu (rainy season) and Kyoto gets properly wet — 228mm of rain and 78% humidity mean you'll want breathable clothing and a sturdy umbrella. But here's the secret: rain-slicked temple stones, misty bamboo forests, and hydrangeas blooming at their peak make this one of the most photogenic months of the year. Crowds drop to low (3/5) because most tourists flee the rain, leaving you with atmospheric temples and no queues for kaiseki restaurants. Temperatures are warm and pleasant around 22°C when the sun peeks through. If you don't mind getting a little damp, June Kyoto rewards you with a moody, intimate beauty that fair-weather visitors never see.",
    7: "July in Kyoto is hot, humid, and absolutely alive — temperatures push toward 30°C with 82% humidity and the heaviest rainfall of the year at 324mm, but the legendary Gion Matsuri festival (all month, climaxing July 17) makes it all worthwhile. Massive wooden floats parade through the streets, Gion fills with festival food stalls, and the energy is infectious. Beat the heat with kakigori (shaved ice), chilled soba noodles, and evening strolls along the Kamogawa river where restaurants set up kawadoko riverside dining platforms. The mountains surrounding Kyoto turn an impossibly deep green, and Japanese macaques are active in the highlands. Come prepared to sweat — and to be completely enchanted.",
    8: "August is Kyoto at its most intense: peak summer heat hits 32°C with persistent humidity, but the cultural calendar more than compensates. The Gozan no Okuribi (Daimonji) fire festival on August 16 lights massive bonfires on five surrounding mountains — it's breathtaking and deeply spiritual. Obon season brings traditional bon odori dancing and a contemplative atmosphere as families honor ancestors. Early mornings at the temples before the heat sets in are genuinely transcendent, and the nearly 10 hours of daily sunshine make everything glow gold. Hydrate aggressively, seek shade at bamboo groves, and let the evening festivals carry you through.",
    9: "September eases Kyoto out of summer — temperatures drop to a comfortable 24°C average and the crowds thin to low season (3/5), giving you breathing room at Kinkaku-ji and Fushimi Inari. The lingering warmth keeps outdoor dining pleasant, and this is prime season for seasonal kaiseki featuring matsutake mushrooms and early autumn ingredients. Rainfall is moderate and typhoon season can occasionally disrupt plans, so keep an eye on forecasts. The first hints of color appear on the Japanese maples by month's end, building anticipation for autumn. A genuinely smart time to visit — good weather, manageable crowds, and the food scene shifting into its richest gear.",
    10: "October is when Kyoto starts showing off again — temperatures settle around a perfect 17-22°C and the Japanese maples begin their slow burn from green to gold to crimson. Crowds pick up (4/5) as autumn-leaf chasers arrive, but it's not yet at November's fever pitch. The Jidai Matsuri (Festival of Ages) on October 22 is a stunning historical costume parade through the city center. Hiking in the Higashiyama hills is superb with cool air and developing fall color, and the food scene features autumn specialties like chestnut sweets and persimmon. If November scares you with its crowds, October gives you 80% of the autumn beauty at 80% of the madness.",
    11: "November is Kyoto's other showstopper — the autumn leaves reach their peak and every temple garden becomes a composition in scarlet, amber, and gold that honestly makes you gasp. Busyness maxes out at 5/5 again (yes, the same as cherry blossom season) as the world descends on Tofuku-ji and Eikan-do for koyo viewing. Temperatures are crisp and pleasant (7-17°C) with low rainfall, making it excellent hiking and temple-wandering weather. Evening illuminations at Kiyomizu-dera and the bamboo grove are absolutely unmissable. The crowds are real, the hotel prices are steep, but seeing those maples reflected in a temple pond at golden hour — there's simply nothing else like it.",
    12: "December wraps Kyoto in winter stillness — crowds vanish (3/5), temperatures hover around 5-11°C, and the bare branches of the Japanese maples reveal temple architecture you couldn't see behind the foliage. Year-end traditions bring special temple ceremonies and the Kaomise kabuki performances in Gion, giving you a taste of old Japan at its most ceremonial. The food scene pivots to warming comfort: hot pot, thick udon, and seasonal wagashi sweets paired with matcha. Occasional dustings of snow on Kinkaku-ji's golden pavilion create one of Japan's most iconic photographs. It's cold, it's quiet, and it's deeply rewarding for travelers who prefer atmosphere over spectacle.",

  'pt-lisbon': {
    1: "Lisbon in January is the city at its quietest — think empty miradouros, no queues at Belém Tower, and pastéis de nata still warm from the oven without the fight. Highs hover around 15°C with frequent rain showers (95mm worth), so pack layers and an umbrella, but you'll still catch crisp sunny spells between the grey. The Atlantic sits at a bracing 15°C — surfing at Ericeira is for wetsuit warriors only. Fado sounds better in the rain anyway, and with budget-friendly prices and almost no crowds, you get the real Alfama experience minus the selfie sticks.",
    2: "February brings the first whispers of spring to Lisbon's seven hills, with temps creeping up to 16°C and slightly less rain than January. Carnival hits the streets mid-month — expect parades, sardine costumes, and a general disregard for Monday productivity. The Atlantic remains a chilly 14°C (its coldest), so beach days are strictly for looking, not swimming. Crowds are still blissfully thin, restaurant reservations are easy, and a steaming bowl of caldo verde after climbing those hills feels earned. This is one of Europe's best-value city breaks if you don't mind a jacket.",
    3: "March is when Lisbon starts to shake off winter — rainfall drops to 50mm, sunshine climbs to seven hours a day, and the bougainvillea begins plotting its colourful takeover. Highs reach 18°C, perfect for wandering Alfama's azulejo-lined streets or taking that tram 28 ride without being sardine-packed. The sea is still cool at 15°C, but Ericeira's swells are excellent for surfers who own decent neoprene. Tourist numbers tick up to moderate, so you're sharing Sintra with some company but nothing painful. A sweet spot for those who like pleasant weather without peak-season prices.",
    4: "April is arguably Lisbon's best-kept secret — 20°C highs, eight hours of sunshine, and spring wildflowers carpeting the hills around Sintra. The rain hasn't fully retreated (55mm), so you'll still dodge the odd shower, but the city's energy shifts from cosy to electric. Outdoor terraces fill up, the Atlantic warms to a still-brisk 16°C, and the surf scene at Ericeira starts buzzing. Crowds are building but manageable, and every bakery is competing for your pastel de nata loyalty. Pair a day trip to Cascais with bacalhau by the water and you'll wonder why anyone comes in August.",
    5: "May delivers the Lisbon dream: 23°C highs, ten hours of sunshine, and rain that's mostly packed its bags at just 40mm. The city is alive — rooftop bars open, sardine season kicks off, and the scent of grilled fish drifts through every bairro. Atlantic waters reach 17°C, tolerable for a quick plunge and increasingly fun for surfers chasing Ericeira's consistent breaks. Crowds are moderate-to-busy but the queues haven't hit full absurdity yet, making this prime time for Belém Tower and Jerónimos Monastery. Honestly, if you can only pick one month, May is the cheat code.",
    6: "June is when Lisbon throws its biggest party — the Santos Populares festivals turn the city into a whirlwind of grilled sardines, cheap wine, and dancing in streets draped with paper decorations. Highs hit 27°C under eleven hours of blazing sunshine, and rain essentially stops (10mm for the whole month). The Atlantic warms to 19°C — refreshing rather than punishing — and the surf is reliable. Fair warning: this is peak season, so Alfama's streets are shoulder-to-shoulder and booking ahead is non-negotiable. But biting into a sardine at a Santo António street party on June 12th? Worth every elbowed queue.",
    7: "July is Lisbon at full throttle — 30°C highs, twelve hours of relentless sunshine, and almost zero rain. The city is packed (peak busyness), prices are at their highest, and tram 28 is basically a mobile sauna of tourists. But the energy is undeniable: beach days in Cascais, surf sessions at Ericeira, and the Atlantic finally hits a swimmable 20°C (by Portuguese standards, that's practically tropical). Evening brings relief as Atlantic breezes sweep through outdoor fado shows and rooftop cocktail bars. Come for the buzz, but book everything months ahead and hydrate aggressively on those seven hills.",
    8: "August delivers more of July's scorching formula — 30°C highs, twelve hours of sun, and crowds that turn Belém into a theme park. Here's the twist: many Lisboetas flee the city for their own holidays, so you'll find some local spots oddly quiet while tourist magnets overflow. The Atlantic holds at 20°C, making beach escapes to Cascais and Costa da Caparica essential survival tactics. Surf conditions at Ericeira remain solid, and outdoor dining is glorious if you snag a terrace with a breeze. Budget-wise this is the priciest month, but a late-evening pastel de nata run through a warm, empty side street is priceless.",
    9: "September is the savvy traveller's July — still 27°C and sunny (nine hours), but the hordes thin out noticeably and prices soften. The Atlantic clings to its summer peak of 20°C, making this genuinely the best month for beach time and surf without the August madness. A bit of rain returns (25mm), usually in quick afternoon bursts that just cool things down. The wine harvest is underway in nearby regions, so day-trip to a vineyard and pair a glass of port with some bacalhau. If you want Lisbon's summer without Lisbon's summer crowds, September is your answer.",
    10: "October is Lisbon's moody-beautiful transition — still a pleasant 22°C but the rain returns in earnest (75mm), painting the azulejo tiles in that glossy, photogenic sheen. Crowds drop to moderate levels, and the Atlantic stays surprisingly warm at 19°C, offering a last gasp of beach-viable conditions. This is prime food season: chestnuts roasting on street corners, hearty caldo verde, and francesinha cravings finally making sense in the cooler air. Sintra in autumn fog is genuinely magical, and surfers at Ericeira catch increasingly powerful swells. Pack a rain jacket and an appetite — October rewards both.",
    11: "November is when Lisbon gets honest about being an Atlantic city — 95mm of rain, 78% humidity, and highs of just 18°C. But here's what you gain: rock-bottom prices, virtually no queues, and the cosy, fado-soaked atmosphere that made Alfama famous. The sea cools to 17°C (surfers in thick wetsuits only), and those five hours of sunshine between rain spells are genuinely gorgeous. This is the month for slow mornings in tiled cafés, custard tarts without the Instagram queue at Pastéis de Belém, and meaningful eye contact with your server. Lisbon's melancholy season has its own quiet magic.",
    12: "December in Lisbon is surprisingly festive — think twinkling lights draped across the Baixa, Christmas markets, and 100mm of rain that keeps things atmospheric (read: wet). Highs sit around 15°C, which by northern European standards is practically mild, and five hours of winter sunshine still light up those famous seven hills. The Atlantic drops to 16°C, firmly in the 'admire from a distance' category, though hardy surfers still hit Ericeira. Crowds are low-to-moderate, spiking around Christmas and New Year's Eve when the Praça do Comércio fireworks draw big numbers. A glass of port wine, a warm pastel de nata, and fado echoing through rain-slicked streets — December does cosy Lisbon better than you'd expect.",

  'tz-serengeti': {
    1: "The southern plains around Ndutu are teeming with wildebeest preparing to calve, and predators know it — expect lions, cheetahs, and hyenas in peak hunting mode. Daytime highs reach 28°C with manageable humidity around 64%, though afternoon showers can roll in (82mm for the month). It's a busy period and lodges book fast, so plan ahead and budget for peak-adjacent pricing. Malaria risk is real year-round here — prophylaxis and long sleeves at dusk are non-negotiable.",
    2: "This is the month. The Great Calving unfolds across the Ndutu short-grass plains: hundreds of thousands of wildebeest drop their young in a frantic two-week window, and every predator on the savanna shows up for the feast. The landscape is lush green, temps hover around 22°C, and the 74mm of rain keeps things dramatic with moody skies perfect for photography. Crowds match the spectacle (busyness: 4/5), so expect premium rates and book your safari vehicle early. Bring your longest lens and your malaria tablets.",
    3: "The herds are still on the southern plains but beginning to stir northward as the calving season winds down. Green savanna stretches endlessly under partly cloudy skies, and temps push toward 29°C — warm but not oppressive. Crowds thin slightly compared to February, and you may find better lodge availability and softer pricing. The rains pick up a touch (82mm), making some tracks muddy, but that golden hour light through scattered clouds is worth every bump. Don't skip the antimalarials.",
    4: "Welcome to the long rains — 129mm of them, to be specific. The herds begin their push west and the savanna turns an almost absurd shade of green, but many tracks become challenging and some camps close entirely. Visitor numbers drop to quiet levels, which means those who brave the mud get the plains practically to themselves and significantly lower rates. Temperatures stay mild around 22°C but humidity climbs to 69%, and the tall grass makes spotting smaller predators trickier. Pack waterproof everything and take your malaria prevention seriously.",
    5: "The tail end of the long rains brings relief — rainfall drops to just 42mm and the savanna starts drying at the edges, though the Western Corridor is greening up as the migration pushes that way. This is one of the quietest months (busyness: 2/5), so budget-savvy travelers take note: lodges are negotiable and vehicles are uncrowded. Afternoon temps around 28°C feel pleasant in the drying air. The birdlife is outstanding right now with resident and migratory species overlapping, and the Big Five are present as always. Malaria meds remain essential through the transition.",
    6: "Dry season clicks on and the Serengeti transforms: just 15mm of rain, humidity dropping to 53%, and that famous tawny-gold savanna asserting itself against the last green patches. The migration hits the Western Corridor and the first Grumeti River crossings begin — crocodiles stake out their positions and the drama is astonishing. Lodges fill back up (busyness: 4/5) and rates climb accordingly, but the clear skies and reliable game viewing justify every shilling. Morning game drives start cool at 16°C, so layer up for the pre-dawn starts.",
    7: "Peak season in full force — the driest month of the year at barely 4mm of rain, with golden plains, enormous skies, and virtually guaranteed Big Five sightings. The herds are moving through the Western Corridor toward the northern reaches, and the Grumeti crossings are in full swing. Expect maximum crowds (5/5), premium pricing, and the need to book six-plus months out for the best camps. Humidity is a comfortable 47% and highs reach 28°C, making this one of the most pleasant months weather-wise. Balloon rides at dawn over the migration columns are unforgettable — if you can stomach the price tag.",
    8: "The main event: herds stream into the northern Serengeti and the legendary Mara River crossings begin — thousands of wildebeest hurling themselves into crocodile-infested waters in a spectacle that's as harrowing as it is mesmerizing. At 10mm of rain and 46% humidity, conditions are bone-dry and the bush is thin, meaning wildlife has nowhere to hide. This is absolute peak season (5/5) with prices to match; a night in a prime northern camp can easily top $400 per person. Temps reach 29°C by midday but mornings dip to 16°C, so that fleece earns its luggage space.",
    9: "Still peak season and the Mara River crossings continue — arguably the best month for catching one, as the herds mill back and forth across the northern plains. The savanna is at its most stripped-back: dry, open, excellent visibility, with afternoon temps hitting 30°C and humidity still mercifully low at 49%. Crowds remain at maximum (5/5) and top-tier lodges are sold out months in advance, but the sheer density of wildlife makes this feel like the nature documentary you always wanted to walk into. Short rains begin teasing at month's end (25mm), signaling the herds to start thinking south.",
    10: "The herds begin their long trek south through the eastern Serengeti, spreading across vast open landscapes that are starting to show early hints of green as rains return (42mm). Temperatures are the warmest of the year at nearly 24°C average, and the wind picks up noticeably to 16 km/h, keeping things from feeling stuffy. Crowds ease from peak to busy (4/5), offering a slightly more relaxed atmosphere while the wildlife remains abundant and visible in the thinning bush. It's a strategic sweet spot: better availability than the peak months, but before the heavy rains arrive. Malaria prophylaxis remains a must as standing water increases.",
    11: "The short rains arrive in earnest — 145mm worth, the wettest month of the year — and the Serengeti erupts back into brilliant green. The migration is pushing south through the central and eastern plains, and the dramatic storm-lit skies make for extraordinary landscape photography between downpours. Crowds drop to moderate (3/5) and rates soften noticeably, making this a smart choice for those who don't mind afternoon showers and occasional muddy tracks. Newborn gazelles dot the plains and resident predators are active, though the tall grass requires a patient eye. Malaria risk ticks up with the rains — take your tablets religiously.",
    12: "The herds are arriving back onto the southern short-grass plains, completing the great circle, and the Ndutu area begins its annual transformation into a wildlife nursery. Rains are heavy (122mm) and humidity sits around 69%, but the storms tend to be dramatic afternoon affairs that clear to golden evenings. Moderate crowds (3/5) and gentler pricing make December a savvy alternative to the January-February rush, especially if you catch the early concentrations of wildebeest before the peak calving chaos. The landscape is strikingly green against the grey kopjes, and birdlife is at a yearly high. Layer on the insect repellent alongside your sunscreen — the mosquitoes are as enthusiastic about the rains as the wildebeest are.",
  },

  'gr-cyclades': {
    1: "January in the Cyclades is for the brave and the curious — temperatures hover around 12°C, the sea is a bracing 15°C, and winds regularly top 27 km/h, so forget beach lounging. Most tavernas and hotels on smaller islands are shuttered, though Santorini and Naxos keep a skeletal pulse going with a handful of open spots and rock-bottom prices. You'll have those iconic caldera views and whitewashed lanes entirely to yourself, which is either hauntingly beautiful or hauntingly lonely depending on your temperament.",
    2: "February is still deep off-season with temperatures barely nudging 12°C and that Aegean wind refusing to let up at nearly 28 km/h. Rain eases a bit compared to January, and you'll get more sunshine hours, but the sea at 14.5°C is strictly for polar-bear types. The upside: Carnival season (Apokries) brings unexpected life to Naxos and Tinos with parades and local celebrations, and accommodation prices remain at their absolute lowest — think half or less of summer rates.",
    3: "March starts whispering about spring — highs reach 15°C, wildflowers begin dotting the hillsides, and the light turns that particular Cycladic gold photographers chase. The sea is still too cold for swimming at 14.5°C and ferries run reduced schedules, but hiking is glorious, especially on Naxos and Amorgos. Most tourist infrastructure remains closed on the smaller islands, though early-bird restaurants start opening on Santorini and Mykonos toward month's end.",
    4: "April is when the Cyclades start to wake up — temperatures climb to a pleasant 18°C, Orthodox Easter often falls here and transforms the islands with candlelit processions and spit-roasted lamb on every corner. The sea at 16°C is still nippy but swimmable for the determined, and ferry routes ramp up significantly. Restaurants and hotels are opening their doors, prices are still very reasonable, and you can visit Santorini's Oia without being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers — a genuine luxury.",
    5: "May is arguably the sweet spot for the Cyclades: 23°C days, 12+ hours of sunshine, minimal rain, and the sea warming to a dippable 19°C. Everything is open and running, the wildflowers are still blooming, and the meltemi winds haven't yet arrived, making island-hopping by ferry smooth and reliable. Crowds are noticeable but nowhere near suffocating — you can still snag a good table without a reservation on most islands, and prices sit comfortably below peak-season madness.",
    6: "June brings proper summer heat with highs near 27°C, virtually no rain, and the sea reaching a lovely 22.5°C — this is when the Cyclades look exactly like the postcards. All islands are fully operational with daily ferry connections, beach bars are pumping, and the early meltemi winds start picking up mid-month, keeping things breezy but occasionally choppy. It's busy and prices are climbing, but you still get more breathing room than the July–August crush, making it the pragmatist's choice for peak experience without peak chaos.",
    7: "Peak season hits hard: 29°C highs, zero rain, 13 hours of blazing sunshine, and the sea a blissful 25°C — it's undeniably gorgeous but you'll share it with everyone. The meltemi winds blow fierce at 26+ km/h, which is a blessing for cooling down but a curse for ferry schedules and beach umbrellas. Mykonos and Santorini command eye-watering prices, restaurant reservations become essential, and the smaller islands like Folegandros and Koufonisia fill up fast too. Come prepared to pay, to queue, and to be dazzled.",
    8: "August is July's twin but somehow even more intense — it's the month all of Greece takes vacation, so domestic tourists flood in alongside international visitors. Temperatures peak around 30°C, the sea hits its warmest at 26°C, and the meltemi winds remain strong enough to strand you on an island for an extra day (not always a bad thing). The Feast of the Assumption on August 15th is a major celebration island-wide with fireworks and packed ferries. Budget generously, book everything months ahead, and embrace the beautiful mayhem.",
    9: "September is the insider's month — the crowds thin noticeably after the first week, temperatures still hit a gorgeous 27°C, and the sea remains at a bathwater-warm 25°C. The meltemi winds calm down, making ferry crossings smooth and beach days peaceful. Prices start dropping, tables open up at those impossible-to-book cliffside restaurants, and the light turns softer and more photogenic. Nearly everything is still open, making this the month where you get 90% of the summer experience at 60% of the hassle.",
    10: "October is a gamble that usually pays off: you'll still see 23°C days and the sea holds at a swimmable 22°C, but rain starts creeping in and some businesses begin their winter shutdown after mid-month. Early October on Naxos, Paros, or Milos feels like a private paradise — warm enough for the beach, quiet enough for long hikes, and cheap enough to splurge on a nicer hotel. Ferry schedules start thinning toward month's end, so plan your island-hopping for the first three weeks.",
    11: "November signals the Cyclades pulling up the drawbridge — temperatures drop to around 18°C, rain returns in earnest with nearly 50mm, and the winds pick back up. Most smaller islands go into hibernation mode with limited accommodation and dining. Santorini, Naxos, and Syros keep some life going year-round, and the upside is genuinely empty archaeological sites, moody seascapes, and prices that'll make you feel like you're getting away with something. Just bring layers and a good book for stormy ferry-day contingencies.",
    12: "December is as quiet as it gets — 15°C days, 65mm of rain, and a 16.5°C sea that nobody is swimming in. The vast majority of tourist businesses are closed, ferry schedules are skeletal, and those postcard-perfect beach clubs are shuttered and eerie. That said, Christmas in a whitewashed Cycladic village has its own magic, particularly on Syros where Ermoupoli's Catholic and Orthodox traditions create a uniquely festive atmosphere. Prices are basement-level and solitude is guaranteed — it's the Cyclades stripped bare, and some travelers find that's exactly what they were looking for.",
